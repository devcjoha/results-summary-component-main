## Summary

After three years without touching code, I decided to once again take on the challenge of specializing as a Front-End developer. I'm not starting from scratch, because even though I don't remember everything right now, I know they're there, in my head, in my hands, and in my fingers.
I decided to start simple, remembering basic concepts and processes. So I take on beginner challenges like Front-End.

### The Challenge

Users will be able to:

- View the optimal interface layout based on their device's screen size
- View the hover and focus states of all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use local JSON data to dynamically populate content.

## My Process
As expected, I didn't even remember that I had to finish with [in Javascript], the programs to install, preparing the PC, the keyboard shortcuts. How fun! I dusted off my notebooks, my Notion notes, my old Github account, etc.
I didn't hesitate for a minute to do the EXTRA challenge, which was appropriate for my memory improvement.

### Continuous Development

I've already designed my learning path with everything I need to remember and advance in my specialization. This is the small first step.
